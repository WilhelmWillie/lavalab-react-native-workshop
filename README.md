# LavaLab React Native Workshop

Hey there! This workshop was made for LavaLab to teach developers how to use React Native to rapidly build mobile apps using
the popular Javascript framework React.

During this workshop, you'll be building a mobile application that will let you search for recipes via public API (Recipe Puppy).
The app will then display results in a nice list with links to recipes related to the given search input.

## Learning Outcomes

* Understand how React Native works and the general development workflow
* Understand how data is passed in React
* Learn how to use React Native components
* How to interface with external APIs through `fetch`

## Pre-Requisites

* Install Node.js and NPM on your computer (https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Install expo-cli on the command line by running `npm install -g expo-cli`
* Download the Expo mobile app so you can test your app on your mobile device (https://expo.io/)
* Optional: Install an Android or iOS simulator. If you download Expo on your phone you should be good but if you prefer, you can use a simulator

This workshop is meant to be beginner friendly but some development experience is expected. Bigger plus if you have experience with React (web) or general HTML/CSS.

## Navigating this workshop

The completed source code for this application is included in this repository. However, I'll walk you through building this app from scratch, all the way from the command line to writing the actual code.

## Project Set up

One of the pre-requisites told you to install expo-cli and install the application on your phone. Expo is a super helpful tool that bridges the gap
between your computer and your mobile device. Expo will handle compiling your code and communicating with your phone so you can code and test without
needing to plug in a device! First though, we need to create an Expo/React Native project.

* Run `expo init recipe-search` into a folder of your choice. This will create a folder called `recipe-search` that will contain the boilerplate React Native code for your application
* Run `cd recipe-search` then `expo start` -- this will start your application via Expo so you can access the app on your mobile device. A web page will open up with a QR code. Scan this on your phone so you can open the app via the Expo app
* (Optional) if you prefer, there will be an option to open the app via an Android or iOS simulator. If you decide to go the simulator route, this is available

At this point, you should see a very basic mobile application on your phone. Open up the `recipe-search` folder onto the text editor of your choice. We will begin grinding out code and making our recipe search app!
