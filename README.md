# LavaLab React Native Workshop

Hey there! This workshop was made for LavaLab to teach developers how to use React Native to rapidly build mobile apps using
the popular Javascript framework React.

During this workshop, you'll be building a mobile application that will let you search for recipes via public API (Recipe Puppy).
The app will then display results in a nice list with links to recipes related to the given search input.

## Learning Outcomes

* Understand how React Native works and the general development workflow
* Understand how data is passed in React
* Learn how to use React Native components
* How to interface with external APIs through `fetch`

## Pre-Requisites

* Install Node.js and NPM on your computer (https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Install expo-cli on the command line by running `npm install -g expo-cli`
* Download the Expo mobile app so you can test your app on your mobile device (https://expo.io/)
* Optional: Install an Android or iOS simulator. If you download Expo on your phone you should be good but if you prefer, you can use a simulator

This workshop is meant to be beginner friendly but some development experience is expected. Bigger plus if you have experience with React (web) or general HTML/CSS.

## Navigating this workshop

The completed source code for this application is included in this repository. However, I'll walk you through building this app from scratch, all the way from the command line to writing the actual code.
